/// Description: Social learning follows: (a) goal prioritizing, when an agent
///   after anticipatory learning is confident; (b) counterfactual thinking, if an
///   agentâ€™s confidence is regained during counterfactual thinking; and
///   (c) innovating, when an agent remained unconfident after counterfactual
///   thinking. The aim of social learning is to learn from social network neighbors,
///   be they successful or unsuccessful. The process is activated regardless
///   of whether the agent is confident or not. This is because both passive and
///   active social learning are captured in the process. The process consists of
///   the following two subprocesses: (a) review the decision options chosen
///   by social network neighbors in the prior period and (b) incorporate into the
///   corresponding mental (sub)model those options that had been unknown. The
///   result of social learning is one or more new decision options.
