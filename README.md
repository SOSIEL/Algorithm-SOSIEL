# SOSIEL Algorithm

The multi-agent SOSIEL (pronounced ˈsōSHəl and stands for Self-Organizing
Social & Inductive Evolutionary Learning) Algorithm simulates the
spatio-temporal complexity of social contexts in which the heterogeneity of
knowledge, the need for learning, and the potential for collective action play
a significant role.
